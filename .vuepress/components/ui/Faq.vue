                        ERC20 provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so
                        they can be spent by another on-chain third party.

                        There are many libraries and tools that provide implementations of standards like ERC20 which
                        you can deploy as-is or extend to suit your needs, as well as Solidity components to build
                        custom contracts and more complex decentralized systems.<br>
                        But you need to learn Solidity, you need to setup your own environment and code and deploy your
                        Token using an Ethereum node.
                        They are a lot of skills and configurations.<br><br>
                        <b>ERC20 Token Generator</b> allows people to think about how their projects can be
                        decentralized (if blockchain would apply to their projects) and not bothering about why
                        node is not syncing, or if Smart Contract is secure and many other blockchain related issues.
                        All of what you have to do is to fill in a simple form and complete the transaction

                                Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications
                                that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship,
                                fraud or third-party interference.<br>
                                These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared
                                global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of
                                property.<br>
                                This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or
                                promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past
                                (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been
                                invented yet, all without a middleman or counterparty risk.

                                DApp is an abbreviated form for decentralized application.<br>
                                A DApp has its backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network.
                                Contrast this with an app where the backend code is running on centralized
                                servers.<br>
                                A DApp can have frontend code and user interfaces written in any language (just
                                like an app) that can make calls to its backend. Furthermore, its frontend can
                                be hosted on decentralized storage such as Swarm or IPFS.<br>
                                For an application to be considered a Dapp (pronounced Dee-app, similar to
                                Email) it must meet the following criteria:

                                    autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The
                                    application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and
                                    market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

                                    The application must use a cryptographic token (bitcoin or a token native to
                                    its system) which is necessary for access to the application and any
                                    contribution of value from (miners / farmers) should be rewarded in the

                                "Gas" is the name for a special unit used in Ethereum. It measures how much
                                "work" an action or set of actions takes to perform.<br>
                                Every operation that can be performed by a transaction or contract on the
                                Ethereum platform costs a certain number of gas, with operations that require
                                more computational resources costing more gas than operations that require few
                                computational resources.<br>
                                The reason gas is important is that it helps to ensure an appropriate fee is
                                being paid by transactions submitted to the network. By requiring that a
                                transaction pay for each operation it performs (or causes a contract to
                                perform), we ensure that network doesn't become bogged down with performing a
                                lot of intensive work that isn't valuable to anyone.

                                There is no way to execute code after a ERC-20 transfer or approval (i.e. making a
                                payment), so to make an action it is required to send another transaction and pay GAS
                                twice.<br>
                                ERC1363 makes token payments easier and working without the use of any other listener.
                                It allows to make a callback after a transfer or approval in a single transaction.<br>
                                There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that can accept ERC-20
                                payments.<br>
                                Examples could be:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        to create a token payable crowdsale
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        selling services for tokens

                                There are lots of tokens lost forever into Smart Contracts. Each Ethereum contract is a
                                potential token trap for ERC20 tokens. They can't be recovered so it means money losses
                                for end users.<br>
                                TokenRecover allows the contract owner to recover any ERC20 token sent into the
                                contract for error.

                                No, your token is not SCAM. It is well tested, it has verified source code, it is used
                                by thousands of tokens. It will be SCAM if you use as it.<br>
                                ERC20 Token Generator has been FREE for use and there are about 10.000 tokens built on.
                                Maybe someone used it to SCAM but it doesn't mean also you will use for it.
